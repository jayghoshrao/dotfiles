# This script creates step files from recent history

# Motivation: A lot of my workflow involves running multiple commands to 
# process data from simulations. A lot of that information is lost thanks to 
# residing only in the shell history and eventually being lost. 
# 
# This, for instance, makes it hard to reproduce postprocessed data from an
# existing set of files after correcting something.
#
# There should be an easy way to document the operations performed on data. 
# Ideally a log file for each program should be generated with all the 
# necessary options and information.
