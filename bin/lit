# @desc: A little script to quickly pull up and open a pdf in the $LIT_DIR. 
#     The name and first two pages of the pdf are searched for the given string. 
#         Results are populated into fzf and pdfs can then be opened. 
#         - C-space: open in place, without exiting fzf 
#         - C-o    : open in okular
#         - C-p    : open in polar-bookshelf
# @notes: 
#     - finds only pdfs, no other files are indexed.
#     - sometimes, the PDF is not opened before the terminal window closes.
#         Trying another time usually does it right. 

# DONE: Test if it finds image based pdfs by their names.
