## Simple script to look at current code in a repo

CACHE_FILE=/tmp/git-peek-cache
REPO="$1"
[ -z "$REPO" ] && exit 1

DIR=$(grep "$REPO" "$CACHE_FILE"  -m 1 | awk '{print $2}')

if [[ -z "$DIR" ]]; then
    DIR=$(mktemp -d)
    git clone --depth 1 "$REPO" "$DIR"
    echo "$REPO $DIR" >> "$CACHE_FILE"
fi

"$EDITOR" "$DIR"
# rm -rf "$DIR"

# Should ideally also be able to see git log (is there a simple script to grab this from github?)
# Should be able to store dir to temp and remember this when run again in a few minutes
# Should open the readme file automatically
