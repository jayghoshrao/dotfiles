## Simple script to look at current code in a repo

REPO="$1"
[ -z "$REPO" ] && exit 1

DIR=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --depth 1 "$REPO" "$DIR"
"$EDITOR" "$DIR"
rm -rf "$DIR"

# Should ideally also be able to see git log (is there a simple script to grab this from github?)
# Should be able to store dir to temp and remember this when run again in a few minutes
# Should open the readme file automatically
